To list all packages use the listpackages command

Create route command:
createroute SYD MEL

Find suitable route command - takes in a package id and prints routes that contain its start & end location
Example:

Assign route command assigns an package to route, it first takes package id and then route id

#### ListTrucksCommand
The `ListTrucksCommand` is used to display a list of **all registered trucks** in the system,
including both assigned and free ones.
Each truck's ID, type, capacity, range, and availability status are shown.

#### ListFreeVehiclesCommand
The `ListFreeVehiclesCommand` is used to display only the trucks that are **currently available (not assigned)**
to any route.
This command helps employees find trucks ready to be assigned.

#### AssignTruckCommand
The 'AssignTruckCommand' is used to assign a free truck to an existing delivery route.
Each route can only have one truck assigned, and each truck can only be assigned to one route at a time.
Attempting to assign a truck that is already taken, or assigning a second truck to a route, will result in an error.
Steps to Execute `assigntruck`
1. Create a route - createroute <StartLocation> <EndLocation> //createroute Sydney Melbourne
2. View available (free) trucks - listfreevehicles
3. Choose the ID of a free truck (e.g., `1001`)
3. Execute the `assigntruck` command - assigntruck <RouteID> <TruckID> //assigntruck 1 1001
Possible Errors:
`Route not found` – if the route ID is invalid
`Truck not found` – if the truck ID does not exist
`Truck is already assigned` – if the truck is already in use
`Route already has a truck` – if the route already has a truck assigned

command Savestate -  Saves the current list of packages, routes and trucks to a text file.
